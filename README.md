# Handwriting-mnist-with-CNN-framework-SVM-RandForest-and-Xgboost


This project aim to show the ideas of how to classify mnist datasets by use SVM, RF, XGBoost,and CNN framework.


After training these classifier with mnist, we can use our own handwritting images to predict. 

There are some method may to help you convert your raw images.

The predict accuracy of own handwriting images may not be valueable cause there are just 50 images.

However, you can add more images and hope this project can show some ideas to you.
